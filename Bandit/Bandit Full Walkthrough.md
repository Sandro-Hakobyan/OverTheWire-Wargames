## Introduction

This is the full collection of my detailed [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) Bandit walkthroughs. Each Level is described in a separate article. As an overall structure each walkthrough has the following structure:

1. Login Information
2. Task
3. Theory
4. Solution

My thought behind this was that I will not just give the solution but also give a short explanation of important concepts and the solution. However, there is always a lot more to learn. _What the game and I would encourage you to do, is to do more research on your own._
